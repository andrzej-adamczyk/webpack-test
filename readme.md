# Page displaying my learning process

My WTF diary which presents 13 weeks of:

1. Things I learned
2. My achievements
3. Homeworks

## How to use it?

Run `npm install` and then use one of following options

- `npm run start` - runs development mode

- `npm run build` - runs build process for production

- `npm run publish` - runs build process and publish the page using `gh-pages` branch
